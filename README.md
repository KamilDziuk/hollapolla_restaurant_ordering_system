- Customers can choose the quantity of each dish.  
- Once all required fields are filled out and the terms are accepted, the order is submitted.  
- Each order receives a unique code.  
- The order is sent to the restaurant and displayed on the page [orders.hollapolla.nl/displaying_orders.php](http://orders.hollapolla.nl/displaying_orders.php).  
- Customer data is stored in a MySQL database and retrieved for display on the website.
